# Face-recognition-for-pictures
This is a python program which matches the known faces with the unknown. In the particular 'faces' Folder any picture can be added. 
Then the test picture can be added to find the face which has been given in the known folder. Unknown photos will be marked unknown.

The libraries needed for this project are-

opencv-python (which is a dependency as stated by Santanu the smart boy)

numpy

face_recognition

cmake 

dlib

All of the libraries can be downloaded with pip command in the terminal followed by the name of the library.

For the output to work the image has to be names as 'test'. The output image, faces folder and the python file should be located in the
same folder.
